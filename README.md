08_Graph_Lab
============

Implement a simple graph class

Requirements
------------

1. Implement all methods of the `Graph` class.

Reading
=======
"Open Data Structures," Chapter 12, the whole chapter. http://opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp/12_Graphs.html

Questions
=========

#### 1. Which of the above requirements work, and which do not? For each requirement, write a brief response.

1. add - my add method passed the test in the main so I'm assuming it works properly
2. remove - this method should work but results in a error that doesn't make sense to me
3. getCost - this method passed the test in the main so I'm assuming it works properly as well

#### 2. For each of your methods, what is the worst-case running time? You may write your answer in terms of `n` (the number of vertices), `m` (the number of edges), `d` (the maximum degree of any node in the graph), or any combination of these. Try to give the most informative bound that you can.

1. add - O(1)
2. remove - O(m)
3. getCost - O(nm)


#### 3. Exercise 12.1 from http://opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp/12_4_Discussion_Exercises.html. You may want to draw by hand, upload the picture online (Instagram, Twitter, imgur, or some place like that), and then just put a link here.

Completed this on my computer but not sure how to post online, don't have twitter, imgur, etc...

#### 4. What is one question that confused you about this exercise, or one piece of advice you would share with students next semester?

There is actually nothing that I was terribly confused about. Yay!
